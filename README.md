# ScriptureTips Browser Plugin

A browser plugin that scans the page looking for references to scripture and converting those references into URL links that you can click on.

You can use it to automatically generate the links in your posts when blogging or writing on forums. It supports BB Code, WIKI Markdown and HTML markup languages.

Any site can be excluded by marking the checkbox when you click the extension's button while visiting the website.
